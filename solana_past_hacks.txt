Solana Hacks, Bugs, and Exploits: A Complete History

Key Findings and Trends
Incident Frequency: 38 verified security incidents over 5 years (2020–Q1 2025), with a peak of 15 incidents in 2022, driven by Solana’s expanding ecosystem, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors. Application Exploits (26 incidents) dominated, reflecting the rapid proliferation of dApps, while Supply Chain Attacks emerged as a new threat in 2024.
Financial Impact: Gross losses totaled approximately ~$600M, with ~$469M mitigated through reimbursements, recoveries, and protocol interventions, resulting in net losses of ~$131M. Users bore the brunt of losses in incidents such as the Slope Wallet hack ($8M) and DEXX exploit ($30M), though protocols also successfully mitigated significant losses, such as Wormhole’s $326M reimbursement and Loopscale’s $5.8M recovery.
Affected Parties: Users were primary victims in Application Exploits (e.g., Slope Wallet, Solareum) and Supply Chain Attacks (e.g., Web3.js, Parcl Front-End), losing funds from wallets and liquidity pools. Network-Level Attacks (e.g., Grape Protocol’s 17-hour outage) and Core Protocol Vulnerabilities (e.g., JIT Cache Bug’s 5-hour outage) disrupted the entire ecosystem, impacting users, dApps, and validators with indirect losses from SOL price volatility.
Response Evolution: Response times improved dramatically from hours or days in 2020–2022 (e.g., Wormhole patched in hours, Cashio shut down same day) to minutes or hours in 2024–2025 (e.g., Thunder Terminal halted in 9 minutes, Banana Gun shut down bots in minutes). Community vigilance, including alerts from CertiK (SVT Token) and ZachXBT (NoOnes), enhanced rapid detection. Remediations shifted from reactive measures like protocol shutdowns to proactive strategies, including audits, 2FA, and real-time monitoring.
Security Gaps: Persistent vulnerabilities include program bugs (e.g., Cashio’s infinite mint glitch), oracle manipulation (e.g., Mango Markets’ $116M exploit), private key management (e.g., DEXX’s $30M leak), and third-party dependencies (e.g., Thunder Terminal’s MongoDB flaw). Core Protocol incidents, such as the Turbine Failure (2023), highlight the complexity of Solana’s high-throughput architecture, necessitating robust validation and fault detection. Insider threats (e.g., Pump.fun’s employee exploit, Cypher’s $317K theft) emerged as a growing concern.
Mitigation Success: Protocols like Wormhole ($326M reimbursed), Pump.fun ($1.9M restored), Banana Gun ($1.4M refunded), and Loopscale ($5.8M recovered) fully mitigated losses, demonstrating effective recovery mechanisms. Raydium partially compensated users (100% for RAY pools, 90% for non-RAY pools), while others, such as Cashio and Solareum, collapsed due to insufficient funds, underscoring the critical need for robust insurance funds and diversified risk management strategies.
Introduction
Solana, launched in March 2020 by Solana Labs, combines Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to deliver a high-throughput blockchain, targeting 65,000 transactions per second at sub-cent fees. Its scalability has driven widespread adoption in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 applications. Still, this growth has exposed it to an extensive array of security incidents—application-level exploits draining hundreds of millions, supply chain attacks compromising ecosystem tools, network-level threats, and core protocol vulnerabilities causing outages and risks. This article provides an exhaustive catalog of Solana’s security history with in-depth research to uncover every known, verified security incident using only high-quality, verified resources.

Application Exploits
Definition

Application Exploits are security incidents that target vulnerabilities in the software applications, programs, or protocol logic built on top of the Solana blockchain. These exploits occur at the application layer, above the core blockchain protocol, and typically involve flaws in the design, coding, or configuration of decentralized applications (dApps), wallets, or DeFi protocols. They often result in unauthorized access, fund theft, or manipulation of protocol operations.

Characteristics

Scope: Specific to individual dApps, programs, or wallet applications, not the Solana protocol itself.
Common Vulnerabilities: Include program bugs (e.g., validation flaws, oracle manipulation), insecure key management, governance loopholes, and third-party service integrations within the application.
Impact: Typically results in financial losses through stolen funds, manipulated transactions, or locked assets. Impacts users, protocols, or treasuries.
Application Level Incidents

Solend Auth Bypass Attempt (Aug 2021)
Root Cause: On August 19, 2021, an attacker exploited an insecure authentication check in Solend’s `UpdateReserveConfig` function. The attacker bypassed admin checks by creating a new lending market and passing it as an account they owned, enabling unauthorized updates to reserve configurations for assets like USDC, SOL, ETH, and BTC. This allowed the attacker to lower the liquidation threshold, making nearly all borrowing accounts liquidatable and increase the liquidation bonus to create significant profits for liquidators (potentially the attacker) through inflating the liquidation bonus.

Repercussions: The exploit attempt put approximately $2 million at risk by making nearly all accounts with borrows liquidatable at an inflated bonus. Five users were wrongfully liquidated by Solend’s liquidator bot, incurring $16,000 in losses. No funds were stolen due to timely detection and intervention by the Solend team.

Incident Response: Solend detected the attack within 41 minutes, mitigated it within 1 hour and 10 minutes, and deployed a fix within 1 hour and 38 minutes. Borrowing operations were temporarily suspended, and the team reconciled the wrongfully liquidated accounts, refunding $16,000 from the liquidator’s undue earnings with a 2% bonus.

Remediations: Solend implemented stricter code review policies, scheduled follow-up audits, increased bug bounty sizes, and added monitoring alerts. They also introduced circuit breakers and speed bumps to prevent similar exploits and patched the vulnerable authentication check in the `UpdateReserveConfig` function.

Lessons Learned: Insecure authentication checks in programs can allow attackers to manipulate critical protocol parameters. Robust access controls, thorough code audits, and real-time monitoring are essential to secure decentralized protocols, especially during early launches.

User Losses: Five users lost $16,000 due to wrongful liquidations, but all were fully reimbursed with an additional 2% bonus from the liquidator’s earnings. No other user funds were lost.

Wormhole Bridge Exploit (Feb 2022)
Root Cause: A signature verification flaw in Wormhole’s Solana-side program allowed an attacker to forge a valid signature, bypassing Guardian validation. This enabled the unauthorized minting of 120,000 wrapped Ether (wETH) without depositing equivalent Ethereum collateral.

Repercussions: Approximately $326 million in cryptocurrency was stolen, making it the second-largest DeFi hack at the time. The exploit disrupted the 1:1 peg between wETH and ETH, raising concerns about cross-chain bridge reliability.

Incident Response: The vulnerability was patched within hours on February 2, 2022. Jump Crypto, Wormhole’s parent company, reimbursed 120,000 ETH on February 3, restoring the 1:1 backing. A $10 million bug bounty was offered to the attacker, who did not return the funds.

Remediations: Enhanced signature verification with stricter input validation and improved account checks to prevent spoofing attacks.

Lessons Learned: Cross-chain bridges require layered security, including robust validation and audits, to mitigate complex smart contract vulnerabilities.

User Losses: None, as Jump Crypto fully reimbursed the stolen funds, preventing direct user losses.

Cashio Exploit (Mar 2022)
Root Cause: A vulnerability in Cashio’s program collateral validation allowed an attacker to mint 2 billion CASH tokens using fake accounts with worthless collateral. The flaw was due to a missing validation of the mint field in the saber_swap.arrow account, enabled the attacker to bypass checks for Saber USDT-USDC LP tokens, exploiting an “infinite mint glitch.”

Repercussions: Approximately $52.8 million in assets (USDC, USDT, UST) were stolen, and the CASH stablecoin’s price collapsed from $1 to $0.00005. Cashio’s total value locked (TVL) dropped from $28.8 million to $579,000, halting operations.

Incident Response: Cashio halted minting at 9:00 AM UTC on March 23, 2022, and urged users to withdraw funds from liquidity pools. The team identified the root cause and collaborated with Saber Labs, which paused its CASH pools. The attacker returned funds to accounts holding less than $100,000 and pledged to donate larger amounts to charity, though $25 million remained unrecovered by June 2022.

Remediations: The vulnerability was patched through community efforts, but Cashio did not resume operations. A proposed two-token protocol and DAO to repay victims was announced in June 2022, but no updates followed.

Lessons Learned: Unaudited programs are highly vulnerable to exploits, emphasizing the need for rigorous audits, robust collateral validation, and a root of trust for account verification to prevent infinite mint scenarios.

User Losses: $52.8 million, partially mitigated; approximately $27.8 million was returned to smaller accounts, leaving $25 million unreimbursed, with no further recovery reported.

Crema Finance Exploit (Jul 2022)
Root Cause: A vulnerability in Crema Finance’s Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM) allowed an attacker to create a fake tick account, bypassing owner verification. Using flash loans from Solend, the attacker manipulated transaction fee data to claim excessive fees, draining funds from multiple liquidity pools.

Repercussions: Approximately $8.8 million in assets (69,422.9 SOL and 6,497,738 USDC) were stolen, impacting Crema’s liquidity pools. The attacker bridged funds to Ethereum, swapping them for 6,064 ETH.

Incident Response: Crema suspended their programs on July 3, 2022, and negotiated with the attacker, who returned $7.2 million (6,064 ETH and 23,967.9 SOL) by July 7, 2022, keeping 45,455 SOL ($1.6 million) as a white hat bounty. The vulnerability was patched within days.

Remediations: Enhanced tick account validation, owner checks to prevent fake data manipulation, and stricter flash loan protections.

Lessons Learned: Liquidity protocols must secure price tick data and transaction fee logic to prevent flash loan exploits, emphasizing the need for robust audits.

User Losses: A net loss of $1.6 million (bounty), unreimbursed; $7.2 million returned mitigated most user impacts.

Nirvana Finance Exploit (Jul 2022)
Root Cause: Attacker Shakeeb Ahmed exploited a pricing mechanism vulnerability in Nirvana Finance’s program using a flash loan of approximately $10 million. By purchasing ANA tokens and manipulating the bonding curve, Ahmed minted tokens at an inflated rate, draining $3.5 million in stablecoins.

Repercussions: Approximately $3.5 million was stolen, collapsing Nirvana’s total value locked and halting operations. The exploit, executed by a trained security engineer, eroded user trust and marked a significant setback for the protocol.

Incident Response: Nirvana shut down post-exploit on July 28, 2022, and ceased communication. In 2023, Ahmed was arrested and pleaded guilty, with $12.3 million in restitution ordered. By September 2024, Nirvana launched a claims portal, distributing 60% of restitution funds to affected users by December 2024.

Remediations: Due to the shutdown, no immediate program fixes were implemented. The relaunched Nirvana V2 (announced September 2024) introduced a “rising floor” price mechanism and protocol-owned liquidity to enhance stability.

Lessons Learned: Custom pricing mechanisms are vulnerable to flash loan attacks, requiring robust bonding curves, external oracles, and thorough audits to ensure DeFi protocol security.

User Losses: $3.5 million, partially mitigated; 60% of restitution funds have been distributed, with ongoing efforts to compensate affected users.

Mango Markets Exploit (Oct 2022)
Root Cause: The attacker, Avraham Eisenberg, manipulated Mango Markets’ price oracle by inflating the MNGO token price through leveraged perpetual futures trades. Using two accounts with $10 million in USDC, he pumped MNGO’s price from $0.038 to $0.91 across exchanges, borrowing $116 million against the inflated collateral.

Repercussions: Approximately $116 million was drained from Mango’s liquidity pools, causing a 50% MNGO price drop and reducing the protocol’s TVL to near zero. After negotiations, Eisenberg returned $67 million, keeping $47 million as a “bug bounty.”

Incident Response: Mango froze deposits on October 11, 2022, and negotiated with Eisenberg, who returned $67 million by October 15. The oracle was patched within days to prevent further manipulation.

Remediations: Improved oracle security with external price feeds (e.g., Pyth, Chainlink) and implemented leverage limits to reduce manipulation risks.

Lessons Learned: Low-liquidity tokens and oracle-dependent systems are vulnerable to economic manipulation, requiring robust price feeds and risk controls.

User Losses: The net loss was $47 million, unreimbursed; $67 million returned mitigated some impact, but no further compensation was provided.

Aurory SyncSpace Exploit (Dec 2023)
Root Cause: On December 17, 2023, a malicious actor exploited a race condition vulnerability in Aurory’s off-chain marketplace buy endpoint. By sending multiple simultaneous buy requests, the attacker inflated their AURY balance in SyncSpace, a hybrid on-chain/off-chain inventory system. This allowed the withdrawal of approximately 600,000 AURY tokens (valued at ~$830,000) to the Arbitrum network, which were then sold on the open market.

Repercussions: The exploit caused an 80% liquidity drop in the AURY-USDC pool on Camelot DEX, reducing it from $1.5 million to $312,000. The AURY token price fell 17% to $1.17, with a 23.5% decline over 24 hours and 36.5% over seven days, though it later recovered slightly. No user funds or NFTs were lost, as the stolen tokens came from a team wallet.

Incident Response: The Aurory team detected suspicious activity within hours and disabled the SyncSpace bridge for maintenance, halting deposits and withdrawals. They absorbed selling pressure by buying back tokens and confirmed the attacker had exhausted their AURY supply. A global backend patch was in development, with a detailed postmortem planned.

Remediations: Aurory is working on a patch to fix the race condition vulnerability and plans to enhance marketplace security. Despite a prior audit by OtterSec, the vulnerability went undetected, prompting a review of audit scopes and processes. SyncSpace is expected to resume operations after fixes are implemented.

Lessons Learned: Race condition vulnerabilities in off-chain systems can lead to significant exploits, even in audited platforms. Comprehensive audit scopes, real-time monitoring, and robust marketplace logic are critical to prevent such attacks, especially for hybrid on-chain/off-chain systems.

User Losses: No user funds or NFTs were compromised. The $830,000 loss (later valued at ~$690,000 due to price drops) was borne by the team’s wallet, used for withdrawals by accounts without prior AURY deposits.

Core Protocol Incidents

Solana Turbine Bug Incident (Dec 2020)
Root Cause: A block propagation bug in Turbine, Solana’s block propagation mechanism, caused a validator to transmit two different blocks for the same slot, which were propagated to separate network partitions (A and B). A third partition detected the inconsistency, but none achieved supermajority consensus due to insufficient stake, halting block production. The issue stemmed from tracking blocks by Proof of History (PoH) slot number (u64) rather than hash, leading nodes to misinterpret distinct blocks as identical, preventing fork repair.

Repercussions: Solana experienced a six-hour outage, disrupting all transactions and dApps. The network split into partitions, with nodes rejecting opposing forks due to differing state transitions, blocking finality. No funds were lost, but early-stage user trust was tested.

Incident Response: Validators coordinated a network restart at 80% stake participation, resuming block production by December 8, 2020. The Solana team identified the bug and deployed fixes to address block tracking and fault detection.

Remediations: Implemented block tracking by hash instead of slot number to distinguish conflicting blocks, enabled earlier fault detection in Turbine, and propagated faults to all validators via gossip. These changes ensured nodes could repair forks and resolve partitions, preventing similar consensus failures.

Lessons Learned: Block propagation systems must track blocks uniquely by hash to avoid misidentification, requiring robust fault detection and gossip mechanisms to maintain consensus in high-throughput blockchains like Solana.

User Losses: None; the outage caused disruptions but no direct financial losses, as no transactions were processed during the downtime.

Helius Labs: “A Complete History of Solana Outages: Causes and Fixes,” February 23, 2025
Solana Durable Nonce Bug Incident (Jun 2022)
Root Cause: A runtime bug in Solana’s durable nonce transactions feature allowed a failed transaction to be processed twice, once as a regular transaction and again as a nonce transaction, due to a recent blockhash. This led to nondeterminism, with validators producing conflicting outputs, halting consensus at 16:30 UTC.

Repercussions: Solana stopped producing blocks for 4.5 hours, disrupting transactions and dApps. SOL’s price dropped 13.9% to $39.08, and trading volume surged 61% to $2.141 billion.

Incident Response: Validator operators restarted the network at 21:00 UTC on June 1, 2022, disabling the durable nonce feature in releases v1.9.28/v1.10.23. Client services were restored over several hours, with no funds lost.

Remediations: The durable nonce feature remained disabled until a fix in v1.10.23 prevented duplicate processing by separating nonce and blockhash domains. Enhanced validation logic was also implemented.

Lessons Learned: Durable nonce transactions require robust mechanisms to prevent double processing, highlighting the need for thorough testing of niche protocol features to maintain network stability.

User Losses: None directly from theft; indirect losses occurred due to SOL price volatility and halted transactions, with no reported reimbursement.

Solana Duplicate Block Bug Incident (Sep 2022)
Root Cause: A faulty validator produced duplicate blocks for its leader slots due to a bug in Solana’s fork choice logic. When validators could not revert to the heaviest bank if its slot matched their last voted slot, they became stuck, preventing consensus and halting the network. The issue was compounded by insufficient confirmed votes, stalling new root block production.

Repercussions: Solana halted block confirmations for several hours, disrupting transactions and dApps. A secondary bug during the restart caused fluctuating active stake amounts due to an inflation mechanism error, overflowing a 64-bit unsigned integer.

Incident Response: Validators restarted the network, aligning on a trusted snapshot to restore consensus. The stake overflow bug was quickly identified and patched before a second restart, ensuring network recovery by October 1, 2022.

Remediations: Later Solana client versions introduced a mechanism to prioritize vote transactions, preventing them from being overwhelmed by regular transactions, and fixed the fork choice flaw to ensure validators could switch to the heaviest fork.

Lessons Learned: Fork choice logic must robustly handle duplicate blocks to maintain consensus, highlighting the need for enhanced vote prioritization and stake calculation accuracy in high-throughput blockchains.

User Losses: None directly from theft; indirect losses occurred due to disrupted transactions, with no reported reimbursement.

Solana Turbine Failure Incident (Feb 2023)
Root Cause: A single large block overwhelmed Turbine’s deduplication logic due to malfunctioning block forwarding services, which continuously reforwarded the block’s shreds. This saturated deduplication filters creating loops in the Turbine tree, forcing reliance on the slower Block Repair protocol and halting block finalization.

Repercussions: Solana  experienced a 9-hour outage starting at 05:46 UTC, disrupting transactions and dApps. SOL’s price dropped 5% to $22.90, with no significant TVL impact.

Incident Response: Validators attempted a live software downgrade, suspecting a recent update (v1.14.16), but ultimately restarted the network at 01:28 UTC on February 26, 2023, using a trusted snapshot. No economic transactions were rolled back.

Remediations: Enhanced deduplication logic in v1.13.7 and v1.14.17 to mitigate filter saturation. Engineers collaborated with forwarding service providers to improve resiliency and planned to replace UDP with QUIC for better traffic control.

Lessons Learned: Turbine’s deduplication logic must handle large blocks robustly, emphasizing the need for optimized forwarding services and protocol upgrades to prevent congestion in high-throughput networks.

User Losses: None directly from theft; indirect losses occurred due to SOL price volatility and halted transactions, with no reported reimbursement.

Solana JIT Cache Bug Incident (Feb 2024)
Root Cause: A bug in the `LoadedPrograms` cache system, introduced in Agave v1.16, caused an infinite recompile loop in the JIT cache. For legacy loader programs, new JIT outputs were assigned a sentinel slot height of zero, making them invisible to `LoadedPrograms`. This triggered continuous recompilation, stalling validators on a specific block and halting consensus at 09:53 UTC.

Repercussions: Solana experienced a 5-hour outage, disrupting transactions and dApps. SOL’s price dropped to a six-day low of $93.75 but recovered to $105.46 within days. Over 95% of the cluster stake, running Agave v1.17, was affected.

Incident Response: Engineers identified the bug, previously seen on Devnet, and deployed a modified patch in v1.17.20. Validators restarted the network at 14:55 UTC using snapshot slot 246,464,040, restoring consensus. The fix disabled vulnerable legacy loaders.

Remediations: Patched v1.17.20 to prevent the recompile loop, with plans for a comprehensive LoadedPrograms overhaul in future releases to enhance cache efficiency and fork awareness.

Lessons Learned: Legacy loader programs require robust cache management to prevent infinite loops, highlighting the need for thorough testing across all network conditions and faster patch deployment.

User Losses: None directly from theft; indirect losses occurred due to SOL price volatility and halted transactions, with no reported reimbursement.

Solana ELF Address Alignment Vulnerability Incident (Aug 2024)
Root Cause: A critical vulnerability in Solana’s ELF address alignment logic, related to the processing of executable files in the Solana runtime, could have allowed an attacker to manipulate program execution, potentially halting the network or enabling unauthorized actions.

Repercussions: No exploitation occurred, as the vulnerability was patched preemptively. The incident had no immediate financial impact, with SOL’s price rising 0.89% to $155.88, reflecting confidence in the rapid response.

Incident Response: On August 7, 2024, the Solana Foundation privately contacted network operators, distributing a patch via an Anza engineer’s GitHub repository. By August 8, 14:00 UTC, 66.6% of the network stake was secured, and public disclosure followed after 70% adoption on August 9. The patch (v1.18.21) was fully implemented without disruption.

Remediations: The patch fixed the ELF address alignment flaw, and additional validation checks ensured proper program loading. The Solana team enhanced private disclosure protocols to prevent reverse-engineering risks.

Lessons Learned: Critical vulnerabilities in core runtime components, like ELF processing, require discreet patching and stakeholder coordination to prevent network-wide outages, emphasizing proactive security in high-throughput blockchains.

User Losses: None; the vulnerability was patched before exploitation, ensuring no financial losses or network disruption.
